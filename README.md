## Domain of Interest

- **Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

While political and health updates surrounding COVID-19 might be overly saturated in today’s news articles and in social media, it is both interesting and pertinent to understand the growing pattern of how each state is handling the pandemic.In particular, we wish to explore a comparison of trends such as stay-at-home orders, the political party of each state’s respective governer, the reopening of public schools and businesses, and the requirement of wearing PPE, etc for each state. While each person might understand the regulations and orders of the state that he/she lives in, we noticed that there was limited sources for a complete dataset regarding the total changes in respect to economic, political, societal impacts of each state and we aim to create a well-rounded source for this information.
